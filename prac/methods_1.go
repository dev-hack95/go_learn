   A method is a function with a special receiver argument.
   The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name.
   In this example, the Abs method has a receiver of type Vertex named v.
   Methods can be defined for either pointer or value receiver types. Hereâ€™s an example of a value receiver. */
